Created a Python program to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI).

Introduction

By recent estimates, large numbers of people in Ireland and other countries are overweight and a significant number are obese. This causes increases in illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease. To determine whether a person is overweight or obese, you can use a measure called the body mass index (BMI). The website of safefood provides one of many BMI calculators you will find online at http://www.safefood.eu/Healthy-Eating/Weight-Loss/BMI-calculator.aspx. Use it to calculate your own BMI. 

There is extensive information about BMI on this Wikipedia web page

Create a BMI calculator Program Description 


The program should allow the user to enter a personâ€™s name (a string).

The program should allow the user to choose whether to enter the values as Imperial or Metric measurements.

If the user chooses to use imperial measurements the height should be entered as feet and inches. The weight should be entered as stones and pounds. The program should convert the entered values to metric equivalents and display them.

If the user chooses to use metric measurements the height should be entered as centimetres. The weight should be entered as kilograms. The program should convert the entered values to imperial equivalents and display them.


The program should then calculate the BMI and display the result.  The program should also display further information telling the user if the persons BMI indicates if they are underweight, normal, overweight or obese using the values shown in this table.
